I love watching all kinds of sports, football, baseball, basketball, and even esports.

## Football

Of course I am a fan of *Mizzou* football.

Being from Kansas City I am an obvious Chiefs fan. My favorite player is definitely **Patrick Mahomes**. 

## Esports
I am a big fan of esports, in particular *Counter Strike*. I'll explain it more [here.](https://github.com/EthanJ11/Final-Project/blob/master/esports.md)
