Here's a few paragraphs that explain Counter Strike and how its played:

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive_  is the latest in a series of a competitive First-Person Shooter (FPS) titles that have come to define a major part of the esports industry. Originally designed as a modified version of popular 1998 FPS  _Half-Life_, the game has since seen multiple iterations and releases from developers working in partnership with Valve Corporation  . The result is a game that has always been one of the top-played games on the PC gaming platform Steam.

The game itself revolves around two separate teams, one designated as the “Terrorists” and the other “Counter-Terrorists”. Rounds are played out with asymmetrical gameplay: each side has different weapons, win conditions, and strategies. The game’s main competitive mode, Bomb Defusal, is centered around Terrorists attempting to plant a bomb and protect it until it goes off, while the Counter-Terrorists focus on eliminating the terrorists or, if the bomb has been planted, defusing it.

In competitions, teams play in Best-of-30 matches, switching sides halfway through. Economy is also a very important element, as actions that help your team (such as killing an enemy or planting/defusing the bomb) earn you money that you can spend at the beginning of the next round. Teams must strategize about whether to upgrade their weapons and equipment, or save money for later. Players can also swap weapons with others on their team, or even pick up a weapon dropped by a dead enemy. These and other elements add significant complexity to competitive strategies, making teamwork and communication key components to any serious match.

This is a picture from the ESL One New York Counter Strike tournament that I attended earlier this year. Attending these big Counter Strike tournaments has become one of my favorite things to do. I hope to attend some of the largest events in Europe eventually.
